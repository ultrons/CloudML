Simple Image Classification Case Study.
Custom model for cat identification and production pipeline.

A Web-app (hosted of Google App Engine) for accessing deployed model will also be posted here soon.

The scripts still bear the name shark ID based on an earlier dataset used for this study.
IN subsequent version this study will be generalized to be applicable to that as well.

More details and scripts to be added on the input data pipeline.
